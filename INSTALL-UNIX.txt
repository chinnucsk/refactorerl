RefactorErl 0.2.1
Installation instructions on Unix


1.  First make  sure that  all  required software  components are  properly
installed and working:

  - Erlang/OTP R11B (http://www.erlang.org/download.html)
  - GNU Emacs 21    (ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/)
  - MySQL 5.0       (http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.0.html)

Newer versions will most probably work, older versions have not been tried.

2. Unpack the  RefactorErl release (probably you have  already done that if
you are reading this file),  we will refer to the resulting RefactorErl-VER
directory as the "base directory".
  
3.  Create a  dedicated MySQL  database for  the refactorer,  and set  up a
database user  to access it. Refer  to the MySQL documentation  to find out
details on how  to do that, but  if you don't care about  the details, here
are the commands you need to type at the MySQL command line:

  create database parse;
  grant all on parse.* to 'USER'@localhost identified by 'PASSWORD';

where  USER and  PASSWORD are  your choices  of a  username and  a suitable
password.

4. Update the  file "db.config" in the base directory  using a text editor,
fill in the username and password you entered in the previous step. You may
update the name of the database as well.

5. Check the  path settings at the beginning of the  file "build.sh" in the
base directory. You need to provide the path to the base directory, and the
path of your Erlang/OTP installation.

6. Run the  script "build.sh" in the base directory.  This will compile the
neccessary Erlang  modules and generates startup scripts.  After this step,
you can use  the generated script file "runerl.sh" to  start the backend of
the refatorer, and  the frontend of the refactorer will  be loaded the next
time you start Emacs.

7.  The  last  step to  complete  the  installation  is to  initialise  the
database. For this, you need to start up the refactorer:

 - run "runerl.sh", which starts the backend
 - then start Emacs, which will load the frontend

Refactoring operations  are accessible  only for Erlang  files, so  open an
arbitrary file with .erl extension (or  create a new, empty one). Then type
"C-c C-e  i" (or select Erlang->Refactor->Initialise database  in the menu)
to complete the installation. From this point, the refactorer is usable.
